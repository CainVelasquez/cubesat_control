# CubeSat ADCS - 

Here you will find simulations for the attitude determination and control (ADCS) of a 2-unit satellite part of the [QB50 project](https://www.qb50.eu/).
This work was done at Mines ParisTech during the year 2014-2015.
For information about the QB50 project and our work at Mines ParisTech, the student webpage for the project is
[here](https://sites.google.com/site/20142015gr02/) (in french only).

Our group was divided into four teams:
- the mechanical team
- the software team
- the ground station team
- the ADCS team which I led

The goal of the ADCS team was to provide the necessary algorithms to ensure the
good behavior of the satellite in orbit: i.e we had to design an observer to
estimate the state of the satellite (its attitude) and a controller to control
it.
More information about this work can be found in our
[report](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnwyMDE0MjAxNWdyMDJ8Z3g6NjdhZWIxMzg2MjJkODRlMw) (still in french).

# Running the code

Please check that you have Matlab 2014b or more recent as this code uses some
functions not implemented in older version.

To run a simulation, you just need to run the "main.m" file. It might take
around 15 minutes as we perform a full simulation on 20 orbits.
